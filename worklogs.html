        <br><br> <b>Worklog 20 Bushes (May 22, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            This is something I also started working on over that May 18 - May 21 bit, but focus most on today.
            I wanted to develop some gameplay into the engine example with bushes. I want bushes
            to be something similar to tall grass in RPGs, where you can find random encounters in them, but be procedurally generated. However,
            there's a catch! The catch being, that the bushes are grouped together, such that every patch of bushes is unique from one-another 
            in some way, whether it be different spawn rates or some other property.

        <br><br> <b>Worklog 19 Terrain Generation 2: Going Isometric (May 21, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            On the 17th, after I had finished working on the engine for the day, I found someone else's project: 2D isometric terrain editor, and it blew my socks off.
            Super charged me with motivation to make my engine support isometric tilemaps, so I spent all of the 18th and 19th implementing that for the first time.
            Given there were some bumps in the road, I was incredibly happy with the result as it had this awesome look. With it, I totally redid all of the terrain 
            generation code, adding grass, lakes, sand, and mountains [PICTURES INCLUDED IN THE LINK].

        <br><br> <b>Worklog 18 Terrain Generation (May 17, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            I spent the entire day continuing my work yesterday better implementing the natural terrain generation by adding new types of tiles
            such as logs and lilies, and I spent the entire day tweaking how the terrain looked. I was super happy with the results as by the end, my two
            little frogs had an entire lake filled with logs and lilies to explore.
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 17 Perlin Noise (May 16, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            This was really fun! After implementing what I thought to be a temporarily satasfactory animation system,
            I thought it was about time I fleshed out the TileMap class. And so I did! Never before had I done anything with 
            perlin noise, however I've always wanted to, so I got out of my comfort zone a little bit, and found an open 
            source implementation for perlin noise on Github and just added it to my code for some really pretty looking
            natural terrain generation!

        <br><br> <b>Worklog 16 Animated Sprites 2 (May 14, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            After a pretty productive day, I went in motivated to finish the AnimatedSprite class so that I could have animation in my game.
            It went really smoothly and I was able to implement what I think to be a mostly simple system with alot of room for improvement. 
            However I am being super cautious of going down the same rabbit hole as I did for the Camera, where I would spent countless hours
            slaving away at miniscule detailts for little, if intangible progress. I ramble though. To summarize, the media engine has animated sprites 
            which is cool.
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/814b9830b1611065e4d893081a914e73028afcf5">(deleted 122 lines and added 463 new lines days, 1,615 lines in total).</a>
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 15 Animated Sprites (May 13, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            I was super fed up with how much time and effort it took to get Camera panning to work, that I went all of April and half of May without touching
            the interactive media engine. However, today I decided to open it up and give it another shot. I had no idea what I was supposed to do after finishing
            panning, so i just picked something random to do like finally get animated sprites. I hoped this wasn't going to be as taxing as working on the Camera class,
            and it wasn't fortunatley. I had made animated sprites once before, though very roughly. Given it was my second time, and I had done a little research 
            before hand, I was able to write most of an AnimatedSprite class (which inherits from the Sprite class) in one day.
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 14 More Camera Work (Mar 31, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            It took nearly the rest of March and a hand full of attempts to implement some more Camera upgrades. I spent a frustrating amount of 
            time unsucessfully getting two different types of camera pans to work. It took some review of triginomotry, some STL math.h documentation reading,
            rewriting the same code a bunch, and the realization that I was doing everything completely wrong for several days before I asked for help and 
            got an absolutely immaculate two line solution to all my problems from a friend. Regardless, now the Camera can pan at a linear or logarithmic speed
            from any point or GameObject to another at any speed.
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/410e1091b0b47ac0ce16afe529e36e4fc45cbae6">(deleted 42 lines and added 177 new lines days, 1,264 lines in total).</a>
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 13 Camera Work (Mar 20, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            I decked out the list of features of the camera. I added camera GameObject and Entity tracking, allowing the camera to follow 
            the player or anything else in the game, additionally, I included a simple but efficient optimization: clipping! Clipping is just when you 
            remove objects from the render queue of a scene that aren't visible. For my interactive media engine, this just meant and if statement
            checking if any of a Sprite's bounds intersect with the frame of the Camera. Implementing it was pretty easy and just really stuck out to 
            me after a productivity drought.
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/410e1091b0b47ac0ce16afe529e36e4fc45cbae6">(deleted 35 lines and added 96 new lines days, 1,129 lines in total).</a>
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 12 Tilemap (Mar 5, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            I got kinda fed up with doing stuff like sprites, collision, entities, and refactoring, so I thought it would be cool to finally get 
            something more than a few squares on the screen. Anyways, I was basically able to design a Tile and Tilemap class I was happy with on the spot 
            because I've written a few Tilemap and Tile classes before. Dispite the lack of planning with my design around this time, I can still say pretty 
            confidently that it is still the best, cleanest and most comprehensive design I have written before and that I was able to get it working like a 
            charm in just an hour or two.
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/7bf7078db79f5bc9c07da13974c3e2aac91f5a87">(deleted 155 lines and added 313 new lines, 1,165 lines in total).</a>
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 11 Refactor (Mar 4, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            Having ripped out most of my hair yesterday from an absurd bug with Sprite's and AABB's sf::Vector2f position references caused by
            copy constructing/assigning smart pointers, I had written so much spagetti code from trying to debug the thing that I decided a refactor was
            necessary. I totally refactored Sprite, AABB, Entity, and cleaned up all sorts of various code across all my classes. Something noteworthy
            is that I made the executive decision to break up my Entity class from being one giant class, to a GameObject class and an Entity class,
            the key difference between the two being the separation of physics.
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 10 Entities (Mar 3, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            I had come to the conslusion, that it makes most sense to me that entities should be responsible for their own collision,
            and that sprites wouldnt conflict with that at all. Taking that knowledge, I wrote a quick AABB class, something I had also 
            never done sucessfully before, and created an Entity class with data members Sprite, AABB, and sf::Vector2f for position. 
            After doing that though, there were some collision bugs I needed to resolve from yesterday which ended up taking alot of time and patience.
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/0ea9dd3a69857a0ab44e7170c30eb3aa5d772c82">(deleted 23 lines and added 338 new lines across the past 3 days, 1,007 lines in total).</a>
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 9 Sprites (Mar 2, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            Alot of today was spent discussing, researching, and thinking on the best and most logical long term solution for the class hierarchy
            and structure of my program. I was wondering if a Sprite class should store its on Axis Alligned Bounding Box (AABB), or if entities should store their own AABBs.
            After some consultation, I wrote a quick SFML Sprite wrapper class called Sprite and got to work planning for what has historically been
            my biggest barrier in terms of previous project design and structure: entities.
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 8 Input (Mar 1, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            After getting buttons mostly working yesterday, I decided to continue and get a Keyboard class set up to emulate what other than a keyboard.
            This Keyboard class would have a multitude of buttons on it to represent the keys on a keyboard, and within each Button class, or key, was
            stored the state of the Button, whether it was just tapped, is being held, was just released, or is on stand by. It took a little bit of finicking
            since my implementation Buttons was different from my previous implementations, but once I got it working, it was better than what I had before,
            but could have been made better still.
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 7 Camera and Buttons (Feb 28, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            Today I did a bit more fine tuning to my StateMachine and other state classes to try to optimize the code's readability, as well as
            start on a Camera and Button class. Buttons are something I have sucessfully implemented in previous projects, but not a Camera. that's why it took
            a bit of extra hastling and time to get an sf::View set up and working. Regardless, today was pretty productive.
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/7e360fdb45cba65ef8570262eb14039d5355b2d0">(deleted 38 lines and added 175 new lines, 692 lines in total).</a>
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 6 Resource Manager (Feb 27, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            Since everything up to this point had mostly been boilerplate code, I thought I would get the last bit of boilerplate out of the way
            and I implemented most of a Resource Manager class. Again like my State Machine class, I had mostly followed my previous designs, but this time
            I tried something new, as I'm always trying to write better, cleaner, more efficient code. Anyways, that something new was a template class Resource Manager,
            basically, instead of writing 3 different, almost identical Resource Managers for graphics, fonts, and audio, I would write a template Resource Manager
            which would be able to store any one of the three independently, and remain clean, readable, and DRY!
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/196e92e89ffec075909bb1bd07492d3fd6454b70">(deleted 5 lines and added 192 new lines, 555 lines in total).</a>
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 5 Refactoring (Feb 26, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            Today was spent cleaning up the code I had so far. The State Machine Operation design I had come up with on the fly yesterday worked, 
            but wasn't perfect by any means. I went through and did some refactoring, renaming methods, changing data member accessibility of some classes and
            writting getters, renaming State Machine Operation back to State Machine Event, but keeping the design the same. Basically, I'm always trying
            to write the best code possible, and I saw that what I had written the past couple of days could've been better, so I did everything I
            could to make it as readable and maintainable as possible. I was happy with myself afterward
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/8e83349b117f68ed135f3896a6773323d75375fe">(deleted 70 lines and added 90 new lines, 368 lines in total).</a>

        <br><br> <b>Worklog 4, State Shenanigans (Feb 25, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            After implementing my new State Machine design, I wrote a State abstract class, and a Game class that implemented the state class.
            Having made a State Machine class, and states for it, I needed to create some event system to be able to add, remove, and change
            the states existing in the State Machine, so I created a State Machine Operation class. With the State Machine Operation class,
            I tried to implement a new design on the fly, which I thought was better then the previous event system style designs I had
            written before. At the end of the day, I committed everything I had to Github for the first time 
            <a href="https://github.com/pritzza/Pritzza-Engine/commit/ea2bc9fb4510b21b7798a9c333d94c80a1fd6529">(348 lines of code!).</a>

        <br><br> <b>Worklog 3, Finally Starting (Feb 23, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            Finally got to work beginning to implement what I had planned earlier. With a bit of frustration and trial and error,
            I had gotten the cleanest State Machine implementation I had ever written. This was not my first time implementing such
            a thing, but what caused some frustration was me trying to incorperate smart pointers into the design. Smart pointers are something
            I've never worked with before, but are considered a best practice in modern C++ development. I was happy to get it working in the end though!
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 2, Setting Up (Feb 22, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p> 
            Today was spent setting up the project. I had to get my C++ Visual Studio and SFML development environment set up.
            After linking all of the SFML libraries with the Visual Studio project, I took some time to create a template project
            so that I wouldn't need to go through with reconfiguring Visual Studio project C++ and link setting ever again.
            Additionally, at the end of setting up the project, I got some quick SFML sample code to verify everything was working, 
            and got a nice green square to appear on an SFML window.
        </p>
        <br><br> <b>Worklog 1, Planning (Feb 21, 2021):</b> <br><br>
        <p>
            Spent the day doing a little bit of research to help plan the initial structure of my engine.
            Figured I would follow a similar design to what I had seen in other people's engines, using a state machine design pattern to help structure 
            the most basic elements of the engine. Sketched out a rough idea of the class structure and hierarchy of the classes I would need to design
            and implement, including the Game/Application class, State Machine class, State abstract class, and Window class.
