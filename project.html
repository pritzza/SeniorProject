            <b>I am going to write my own interactive media engine.</b> <br><br>
            
            I have always loved videogames and other interactive media, and recently I've become fascinated with the technology behind them, and 
            how they're made. So in my journey to learn how computers have changed escapism, I thought what better way to learn about the 
            the most engaging forms of escapism then to write my own engine for it.

            <br><br>
            In creating my own interactive media engine, not only will I gain a better understanding of how interactive media is made, but how the software 
            behind it is made as well.
            In addition, my project will be an open source frame work, avaliable to all for free, and may be used in any way, including: a tool to make 
            interactive media, and a resource to learn C++, programming, computer science, SFML, game development, or interactive media development.

            <br><br>
            That being said, the ultimate goal of my project is to write my own interactive media engine.
            This will be done in C++, Microsoft Visual Studio as my IDE, STL, and SFML, with all of the source code always avaliable
